We will index the emails in ChromaDB using HuggingFace embeddings and then will use Langchain and Llama 2 to query about the indexed content.\n\n## Definitions\n\n* LLM - Large Language Model  \n* Llama 2.0 - LLM from Meta \n* Langchain - a framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using LLMs\n* Vector database - a database that organizes data through high-dimmensional vectors  \n* ChromaDB - vector database  \n* RAG - Retrieval Augmented Generation \n\n## Model details\n\n* **Model**: Llama 2  \n* **Variation**: 7b-chat-hf  (7b: 7B dimm. hf: HuggingFace build)\n* **Version**: V1  \n* **Framework**: PyTorch  \n\nLlaMA 2 model is pretrained and fine-tuned with 2 Trillion tokens and 7 to 70 Billion parameters which makes it one of the powerful open source models. It is a highly improvement over LlaMA 1 model.","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#

He is\nlooking to move into more of a quantitative role which will utilise his\ndeveloping  skills and also his statistical and theoretical knowledge as\nwell. The issue is that he is based in Chicago and I wondered if there\nwould be any interest from your headquarters there.\n\nPlease find attached his details.\n\nSpeak to you soon.\n\nRegards\n\nSimon\n\n\n\n - D0075530.DOC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nText:  To: frozenset({'amy.fitzpatrick@enron.com'})\nFrom: frozenset({'vince.kaminski@enron.com'})\nX-To: Amy FitzPatrick\nX-From: Vince J Kaminski\ncontent: Amy,\n\nYes, I am interested.
