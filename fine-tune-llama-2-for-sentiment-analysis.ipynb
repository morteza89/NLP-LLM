Sentiment analysis on financial and economic information is highly relevant for businesses for several key reasons, ranging from market insights (gain valuable insights into market trends, investor confidence, and consumer behavior) to risk management (identifying potential reputational risks) to investment decisions (gauging the sentiment of stakeholders, investors, and the general public businesses can assess the potential success of various investment opportunities).\n\nBefore the technicalities of fine-tuning a large language model like Llama 2, we have to find the correct dataset to demonstrate the potentialities of fine-tuning.\n\nParticularly within the realm of finance and economic texts, annotated datasets are notably rare, with many being exclusively reserved for proprietary purposes. To address the issue of insufficient training data, scholars from the Aalto University School\nof Business introduced in 2014 a set of approximately 5000 sentences. This collection aimed to establish human-annotated benchmarks, serving as a standard for evaluating alternative modeling techniques. The involved annotators (16 people with\nadequate background knowledge on financial markets) were instructed to assess the sentences solely from the perspective of an investor, evaluating whether the news potentially holds a positive, negative, or neutral impact on the stock price.\n\nThe FinancialPhraseBank dataset is a comprehensive collection that captures the sentiments of financial news headlines from the viewpoint of a retail investor. Comprising two key columns, namely \"Sentiment\" and \"News Headline,\" the dataset effectively classifies sentiments as either negative, neutral, or positive. This structured dataset serves as a valuable resource for analyzing and understanding the complex dynamics of sentiment in the domain of financial news. It has been used in various studies and research initiatives, since its inception in the work by Malo, P., Sinha, A., Korhonen, P., Wallenius, J., and Takala, P.  \"Good debt or bad debt: Detecting semantic orientations in economic texts.\", published in the Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology in 2014.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As a first step, we install the specific libraries necessary to make this example work.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* accelerate is a distributed training library for PyTorch by HuggingFace.

PEFT methods only fine-tune a small number of (extra) model parameters, thereby greatly decreasing the computational and storage costs.\n* bitsandbytes by Tim Dettmers, is a lightweight wrapper around CUDA custom functions, in particular 8-bit optimizers, matrix multiplication (LLM.int8()), and quantization functions. It allows to run models stored in 4-bit precision: while 4-bit bitsandbytes stores weights in 4-bits, the computation still happens in 16 or 32-bit and here any combination can be chosen (float16, bfloat16, float32, and so on).\n* transformers is a Python library for natural language processing (NLP). It provides a number of pre-trained models for NLP tasks such as text classification, question answering, and machine translation.\n* trl is a full stack library by HuggingFace providing a set of tools to train transformer language models with Reinforcement Learning, from the Supervised Fine-tuning step (SFT), Reward Modeling step (RM) to the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) step.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Installations and imports","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install -q -U \"torch==2.1.2\" tensorboard","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-24T13:09:43.523092Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-24T13:09:43.523360Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-24T13:09:57.566460Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-03-24T13:09:43.523336Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-03-24T13:09:57.565179Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"\u001b[31mERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed.

If you want to save the full model for easier use with Text Generation Inference, you can merge the adapter weights into the model weights using the merge_and_unload method. Then, you can save the model using the save_pretrained method. This will create a default model that's ready for inference tasks.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Before proceeding, we first remove the previous model and clean up the memory from various objects we won't use anymore.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import gc\n\ndel [model, tokenizer, peft_config, trainer, train_data, eval_data, bnb_config, training_arguments]\ndel [df, X_train, X_eval]\ndel [TrainingArguments, SFTTrainer, LoraConfig, BitsAndBytesConfig]","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-24T14:20:52.245315Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-24T14:20:52.245626Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-24T14:20:52.251414Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-03-24T14:20:52.245601Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-03-24T14:20:52.250540Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":20,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"for _ in range(100):\n    torch.cuda.empty_cache()\n    gc.collect()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-24T14:20:52.252620Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-24T14:20:52.252969Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-24T14:21:26.062160Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-03-24T14:20:52.252944Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-03-24T14:21:26.061110Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":21,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!nvidia-smi","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-24T14:21:26.065130Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-24T14:21:26.065439Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-24T14:21:27.085930Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-03-24T14:21:26.065414Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-03-24T14:21:27.084757Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":22,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Sun Mar 24 14:21:26 2024       \n+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| NVIDIA-SMI 535.129.03             Driver Version: 535.129.03   CUDA Version: 12.2     |\n|-----------------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\n| GPU  Name                 Persistence-M | Bus-Id        Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr.
